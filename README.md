# Overengineered potato gun
An over-engineered, 3D-printed, Arduino-controlled potato cannon that turns spuds into high-speed projectiles. Because why launch potatoes the simple way when you can do it with science and style?

The gun is built using high-pressure rated PVC pipes and a variety of custom-designed parts that I 3D printed myself. It operates on a propane-butane mixture and features an Arduino controller to tackle with settings, automate various processes and measure the spud speed.

## Components

Here's a quick rundown of the main components inside the potato gun:

- **High-Voltage Generator**: Creates the spark needed to ignite the fuel mixture.
- **Fan**: Ensures even distribution of the air-fuel mixture and helps purge the combustion chamber of exhaust gases.
- **Electro-Mechanical Gas Valve**: Automatically controls the gas flow to ensure the right mixture for combustion.
- **Small LED Display**: Allows you to manage various settings; inputs are made via an encoder combined with a button.
- **Chronograph at the Muzzle**: Measures the speed of the projectile as it exits the barrel.

This project is a blend of engineering, creativity, and a bit of backyard fun. I hope you find it as exciting and interesting as I do.
